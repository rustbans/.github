# RustBans
RustBans is a dedicated platform aimed at improving the gaming experience by identifying and sharing information about players who cheat in Rust. Our primary goal is to maintain a clean and fair gaming environment by exposing CHEATERS and providing essential data to both users and administrators.

## Key Features
1. CHEATER Profiles: Centralize and share comprehensive profiles of CHEATER players, including detailed reasons for their addition to the database.

2. API Support: Implement robust API support to enable seamless integration and data retrieval for developers and third-party services.

3. Server Plugin: Offer a customizable server plugin to enhance the utility and accessibility of RustBans directly within the game environment.

## Upcoming Developments
We are committed to developing an intuitive interface that allows users and administrators to easily access and interpret data.
And plans are underway to incorporate advanced data analysis tools for more effective CHEATER detection and reporting.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build and improve RustBans, striving towards a cheat-free gaming experience in Rust.
